# Open Pull Requests - Resolution Guide

## Summary

This repository has **6 open pull requests** that are all experiencing Vercel deployment failures. This document explains the root cause and provides a clear resolution path.

## Root Cause

All PRs are failing Vercel deployment checks because the Vercel GitHub integration is misconfigured. The repository has:

- **Backend (NestJS)** at the root directory (`/`)
- **Frontend (Next.js)** in the `/frontend` subdirectory

However, the Vercel project integration is attempting to deploy from the root, which contains the backend code instead of the frontend.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

### Option 1: Configure Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

**Update the Vercel project configuration:**

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `quemiai` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Under "Root Directory", change from empty/root to: **`frontend`**
5. Click **Save**

After this change, all PRs will automatically redeploy and CI checks should pass.

### Option 2: Alternative Workaround (If Dashboard Access Not Available)

If you cannot access the Vercel dashboard, you may need to:
1. Delete the current Vercel project integration
2. Re-create it with the correct root directory setting
3. Or configure Vercel via CLI instead of GitHub integration

The programmatic vercel.json approaches attempted in this PR have not worked because Vercel's monorepo support requires dashboard configuration for GitHub integration deployments.

### Why This Is Needed

According to `VERCEL_MIGRATION.md` in this repository:
- The `rootDirectory` option is **not supported in vercel.json**
- It must be configured in the Vercel Dashboard project settings
- This tells Vercel to build and deploy from the `/frontend` directory instead of the repository root

## Open Pull Requests Analysis

### PR #26 (This PR) - ✅ Fix All Open PRs

**Status**: In progress  
**Purpose**: Consolidate fixes and close/merge all open PRs  
**Action**: Will provide guidance for resolving all PRs once Vercel config is fixed

### PR #21 - Add vercel.json Vercel rootDirectory config

**Status**: Open, deployment failing  
**Purpose**: Adds root `vercel.json` with `rootDirectory: "frontend"`  
**Issue**: The `rootDirectory` property is not supported in vercel.json (per VERCEL_MIGRATION.md)  
**Action**: **Close this PR** - the solution is to configure Vercel in the dashboard, not in vercel.json

### PR #22 - Add rootDirectory to vercel.json

**Status**: Draft, deployment failing  
**Purpose**: Adds root `vercel.json` with `rootDirectory: "frontend"` plus extra config  
**Issue**: Same as #21 - `rootDirectory` not supported in vercel.json  
**Action**: **Close this PR** - superseded by dashboard configuration

### PR #18 - Configure vercel.json backend-only

**Status**: Draft, deployment **succeeded** ✅  
**Purpose**: Configures backend-only deployment with `framework: null`  
**Issue**: This deploys the backend instead of the frontend, which contradicts DEPLOYMENT.md  
**Action**: **Close this PR** - incorrect deployment strategy

**Note**: This PR passed CI because it successfully deployed the backend to Vercel. However, according to DEPLOYMENT.md, the frontend should be deployed to Vercel, not the backend.

### PR #25 - Set up Copilot instructions

**Status**: Draft, deployment failing  
**Purpose**: Adds comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md`  
**Content**: 333-line guide for GitHub Copilot with project standards  
**Action**: **Merge after Vercel config fix** - good documentation, just needs CI to pass

### PR #19 - Harden .gitignore

**Status**: Draft, deployment failing  
**Purpose**: Adds comprehensive `.env.*.local` pattern and security improvements  
**Content**: Security-focused .gitignore improvements  
**Action**: **Merge after Vercel config fix** - good security improvement

### PR #17 - Add monitoring documentation

**Status**: Draft, deployment failing  
**Purpose**: Adds MONITORING_GUIDE.md (951 lines) and updates DEPLOYMENT.md  
**Content**: Comprehensive monitoring and observability documentation  
**Action**: **Merge after Vercel config fix** - excellent documentation

## Recommended Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Fix Vercel Configuration (Required First)

```bash
# This is done in Vercel Dashboard, not code:
1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select quemiai project
3. Settings → General → Root Directory → Set to "frontend"
4. Save changes
```

### Step 2: Close Conflicting PRs

Once Vercel is configured correctly:

1. **Close PR #18** (backend-only config - incorrect approach)
2. **Close PR #21** (rootDirectory in vercel.json - not supported)
3. **Close PR #22** (rootDirectory in vercel.json - not supported)

### Step 3: Merge Documentation PRs

Once CI passes (after Vercel config fix):

1. **Merge PR #25** (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
2. **Merge PR #19** (.gitignore hardening)
3. **Merge PR #17** (MONITORING_GUIDE.md)

### Step 4: Close This PR

Once all other PRs are resolved:
- Close PR #26 (this meta-PR) as complete

## Verification

After configuring Vercel, verify the fix works by:

1. Triggering a re-deployment on any open PR
2. Checking that Vercel builds from `/frontend` directory
3. Verifying CI status changes from ❌ to ✅

## Additional Notes

### Why No Root vercel.json?

From `VERCEL_MIGRATION.md`:
> The `rootDirectory` option is not supported in vercel.json. The Root Directory must be set in Vercel Project Settings in the dashboard.

### What About the Existing frontend/vercel.json?

The `/frontend/vercel.json` file already exists and has the correct configuration for the Next.js frontend. No changes needed there.

## What Was Attempted in This PR?

This PR attempted several programmatic solutions:

1. ✅ **Created comprehensive analysis** of all open PRs
2. ✅ **Identified root cause** - Vercel project misconfiguration
3. ❌ **Tried root vercel.json with `rootDirectory`** - Property not supported per VERCEL_MIGRATION.md
4. ❌ **Tried root vercel.json with build commands** - Vercel GitHub integration doesn't support this pattern
5. ✅ **Documented resolution path** - Requires dashboard configuration

### Why Programmatic Solutions Failed

Vercel's GitHub App integration has specific requirements:
- For monorepo deployments, the "Root Directory" must be set in the dashboard
- The vercel.json at root cannot override the GitHub integration's build path
- Build commands in root vercel.json are not respected by the GitHub integration

The only working solution is dashboard configuration or re-creating the Vercel project with correct settings.

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

1. **Configure Vercel Dashboard** (5 minutes)
   - Set Root Directory to `frontend` in project settings

2. **Verify Deployment** (automatic)
   - All open PRs will redeploy and pass CI

3. **Close Conflicting PRs**
   - Close #18 (backend deployment)
   - Close #21 (simple config)
   - Close #22 (conflicting config)

4. **Merge Documentation PRs**
   - Merge #17 (monitoring docs)
   - Merge #19 (.gitignore)
   - Merge #25 (copilot instructions)

5. **Close This PR**
   - Close #26 after all others resolved
