# Load Testing Guidance

Load testing is crucial to ensure the Joachima backend can handle high volumes of traffic and maintain performance under stress. This document outlines a general approach and recommended tools for load testing.

## 1. Define Load Testing Goals

Before starting, clearly define what you want to achieve with load testing:

*   **Performance Benchmarks:** What are the acceptable response times for critical API endpoints (e.g., posting a message, fetching a feed, getting recommendations)?
*   **Scalability Limits:** At what point does the system start to degrade? How many concurrent users can it support?
*   **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, network, and database usage under load.
*   **Breakpoints:** Identify the maximum load the system can handle before breaking.

## 2. Identify Critical User Flows

Focus on the most frequent and resource-intensive user interactions:

*   User login/logout
*   Posting messages/content
*   Fetching social feeds
*   Sending/receiving real-time messages (WebSocket)
*   Getting AI recommendations
*   Uploading multimedia (portfolio, video for transcoding)
*   Initiating marketplace transactions

## 3. Choose Load Testing Tools

Several tools can simulate user load. Here are some recommendations:

*   **JMeter:** A powerful, open-source tool for load testing web applications, APIs, and more. It supports various protocols, including HTTP/S and WebSocket.
    *   **Pros:** Highly configurable, supports complex test plans, good for detailed reporting.
    *   **Cons:** Steeper learning curve, resource-intensive for very high loads.
*   **Locust:** An open-source, Python-based load testing tool that allows you to define user behavior in Python code.
    *   **Pros:** Easy to write complex user scenarios, distributed testing, web-based UI for monitoring.
    *   **Cons:** Requires Python knowledge.
*   **k6:** A modern, open-source load testing tool written in Go, with test scripts written in JavaScript.
    *   **Pros:** Developer-friendly, good for CI/CD integration, efficient for high loads.
    *   **Cons:** Newer, so community support might be smaller than JMeter.

## 4. Design Test Scenarios

Create realistic test scenarios that mimic actual user behavior. Consider:

*   **Concurrent Users:** How many virtual users will be active simultaneously?
*   **Ramp-up Period:** How quickly will the virtual users be added?
*   **Duration:** How long will the test run?
*   **Think Time:** Simulate pauses between user actions.
*   **Data Parameterization:** Use dynamic data for requests (e.g., different user IDs, post content).

## 5. Execute Tests and Monitor

Run your load tests and closely monitor the backend infrastructure:

*   **Application Metrics:** Use tools like Google Cloud Monitoring, Prometheus, or Grafana to track API response times, error rates, and throughput.
*   **Database Metrics:** Monitor database performance (query times, connections, CPU/memory usage).
*   **Server Metrics:** Track CPU, memory, and network usage of your application servers.
*   **Firebase Monitoring:** Utilize Firebase Performance Monitoring and Crashlytics for client-side performance and stability.

## 6. Analyze Results and Iterate

*   **Identify Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint areas where performance degrades.
*   **Optimize:** Implement optimizations (e.g., add caching, optimize database queries, scale resources).
*   **Retest:** Rerun tests after optimizations to verify improvements.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively load test the Joachima backend and ensure its readiness for a large user base.
