# Security Protocols

This document outlines the security protocols for the Joachima social media super app.

## Authentication

*   **Firebase Authentication:** We will use Firebase Authentication for email/password, phone number, and social media logins (Google, Facebook, Twitter).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA will be implemented to provide an extra layer of security for user accounts.
*   **OAuth 2.0:** We will use OAuth 2.0 for authorizing third-party social media integrations.

## Data Encryption

*   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** All messages and user-generated content will be end-to-end encrypted using the Signal Protocol.
*   **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between the client and the server will be encrypted using TLS 1.3.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** All data stored in Firestore will be encrypted at rest by default.

## API Security

*   **API Keys:** API keys for third-party services will be stored securely using Google Secret Manager.
*   **Token Management:** We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API authentication and authorization.
*   **Rate Limiting:** We will implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

## Compliance

*   **GDPR/CCPA:** We will ensure that the app is compliant with GDPR and CCPA regulations.
*   **Data Privacy:** We will provide users with clear and transparent information about how their data is collected, used, and shared.
